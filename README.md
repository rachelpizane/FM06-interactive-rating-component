### 4.2. What I learned

By completing this project with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I significantly improved my Javascript skills, particularly in functions, conditionals, and DOM manipulation. 

In addition to the requested features, I implemented a button that allows users to return to the homepage, resetting any previously submitted evaluation. 

Furthermore, I added a condition that displays an alert if the user tries to click "Submit" without selecting an evaluation, informing them of the need to choose one before submitting.
